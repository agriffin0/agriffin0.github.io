    <h1>hello, world</h1>
    <p>My name is Ashley Griffin. 
        I have a background in website management and digital marketing in the news and higher education industries.</p>
    <p>In 2020, I began my computer science journey, learning more about HTML and C through online courses, such as Codecademy and CS50x.
        Through these courses, I've learned the basics of C, Python, HTML, SQL, and more.
        In 2023, I'm working to further my knowledge with additional projects, which I'll post here on GitHub.

    <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
